- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pernajl,
- 👀 I’m interested in health care discourses from a linguistics perspective. Currently writing my PhD thesis about metaphors in discourses of menopause. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use critical metaphor analysis, integrating appraisal theory, social actor theory and other approaches, which are traditionally applied within Critical Discourse Studies. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on linguistic approaches to metaphor and linguistic approaches to discourses of health.
- 📫 @Pernajl on Twitter is my preferred channel for academic networking.
